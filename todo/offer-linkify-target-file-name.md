# Offer linkify file name of the target

Spaces are not valid in MarkDown link targets so it would be good to offer some sort of a UI to rename the target file first by replacing spaces with dashes and then link to the new name.

Maybe we can do two suggestions in the suggestion list, the existing name and the edited name and somehow illustrate the difference.

Or once suggestion is commited, we can display a choice popover thingy VS Code has where the user could click (or gesture, keyboard shortcut?) to have the now-invalid inserted path fixed by renaming it and the target.
