# Research collapsing

See if a MarkDown link syntax like `[link](https://example.com/)` could be somehow collapsed (like outlining but on one line).

If yes, hide the surrounding syntax so it ends up looking like this: `link`.
And at the same time have a `DocumentLinkProvider` for the `link` range in the syntax, so the link text becomes clickable and target hidden.
